            <h2>Hello There!</h2>
            <p>Originally from Nebraska, I have lived on the East Coast, the West Coast, Midwest and the South. As a nurse, I worked as a travel nurse for a little time to help with the travel bug I seem to have. On top of that, I have been to 50 different countries and counting. I love to see different places and cultures as it creates a whole different perspective.

          <h3>How did it all begin?</h3>
          <p>Growing up I never saw myself as the creative type. I felt myself more drawn to science and math but always did like art class. Naturally, I followed a path that combined both science and math and went into nursing school. Working in a ER and ICU setting, I learned how to explain complex things to patients and family members. I learned that not everybody learns in the same fashion and l’m now able to recognize that people have their own unique information architecture. Year and after year working I lost my passion for it and became more interested in the aesthetics of the world. <br>My friend heard all my woes about nursing and told me to get into coding. I started off with HTML and CSS and fell in love with it. I would spend hours trying to learn how to code these beautiful websites and I came to the realization that I liked the design aspect of HTML and CSS and not the actual coding part, which lead me to discover UX/UI design. People have always been the center of my work, which made UX all that more appealing to me. From there I did my research and found CareerFoundry’s UX design program and quickly started. Working with a mentor that has experience in UX/UI design for small businesses, large corporations and freelance, I have developed my UX/UI skills to a new and great level. I obtained my UX design certificate in September 2020 with a specialization in UI design and Front-End Development.
          </p>
          <h3>Where to next?</h3>
          <p>Currently, I am looking for a full-time position as a UX/UI designer. I am very open to relocation and remote work. <br>I am looking forward to putting my skills to the test and working for a company that helps out everyday people and makes a positive impact on people’s lives. I have a great passion for healthcare, animals, food and fitness. I really want to make complex systems easier to navigate for a greater population.
